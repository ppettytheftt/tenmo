# TEnmo Capstone

This Capstone simulates a program similar to Venmo, it demonstrates basic concepts of a fullstack application.
This project was a pair-programming project my partner and I had done during week 9 at Tech Elevator.
CLI and main application uses Java, while the databases (creating, reading, updating, and deleting) use PostgreSQL.
